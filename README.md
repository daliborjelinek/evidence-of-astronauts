# evidence-of-astronauts
I've created this simple project to get more familiar with Vuetify which really impressed me and to present my front-end skills in 2020.

**Thanks to:**
- Icon8 for [Astronaut Helmet icon](https://icons8.com/icon/88825/astronaut-helmet).
- Vazha Omanashvili for awesome [Json generoator](https://next.json-generator.com/).
- Tobias Ahlin for fancy [CSS spinner](https://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/) .
